# farmo

## Project Title and Description:
farmo is a Jupyter Notebook repository that aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing agricultural data and optimizing farm management practices.

## Features:
- Data visualization tools for understanding crop performance and environmental factors
- Machine learning models for predicting crop yields and identifying disease outbreaks
- Optimization algorithms for crop rotation planning and resource allocation
- Interactive notebooks for exploring agronomic research findings

## Technologies Used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

## Prerequisites:
- Jupyter Notebook installed on your system
- Python environment set up with required libraries

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rajan3208/farmo.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn numpy
   ```

## Configuration:
No specific configuration is required for this project.

## Usage:
To start analyzing agricultural data, open the Jupyter notebooks in the repository and run the cells sequentially. Below is an example of loading and visualizing crop yield data using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('crop_yield_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

## API Reference:
This project does not have an API component.

## Testing:
To run tests, navigate to the 'tests' directory and execute the test files using a testing framework like pytest.
